# online-shop
BuyBook is an online store based on the Spring framework, where you can buy books of any choice. Advantages of our store: 
- the ability to purchase both electronic and printed copies;
- a wide range of choices;
- affordable prices. 
The purpose of our project is to promote books in society, to make books available to those who due to certain circumstances are not able to buy them in a bookstore.
